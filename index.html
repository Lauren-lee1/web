    Key Strokes
</h2> <!-- Puts my name as heading 2 -->
<p> 
  <br> There are six basic strokes to tennis and the mastery of all these strokes can lead to sucess on court. </br>
  <br> First is the serve. The most important and crucial shot in tennis is the serve and can either make or break your game. During the serve, you are essentially controlling how the game will start because you have the ball in your hand. I would argue that the serve is exteremly hard to perfect so take your time with learning it. A basic serve is all about the toss. Place the ball in the air where you want it to go. In the ideal position for you to extend your racket up and hit it in the sweet spot. As you advance, the placement of your ball will change depending on if you want a slice serve, a kick serve, or just a flat serve. </br>
  <br> The second and third stroke are the groundstrokes. The forehand is hit with your dominant hand swinging from the right side (If you are a righty. If not, just switch the sides) cross to the left shoulder of your body. The backhand is a two handed or one handed stroke hit from the non-dominant side of your body across to your dominant shoulder. Beginners should start with a two handed stroke. The key for these strokes is to always start low, turn your body, and end at your shoulder. </br>
  <br> The next two strokes are the volleys. The volley is essentially a stop sign you hold near the net. The forehand volley is with your dominant hand and the dominant side of your body and the backhand volley is hit with your dominant hand on the non-dominant side of your body. When volleying, don't swing. Just hold your racket up and allow the ball to hit your racket. Make sure you don't swing back your racket. </br>
  <br> The last stroke is the overhead smash. At the net, you will either encounter a low ball in which you will have to hit a volley or a high ball in which you will have to hit a overhead. The overhead is a tricky shot and many professionals fail to get this right. Even world #1 Novak Djokovic couldn't do it for some time. It is essentially a serve but instead of placing the ball in the air, you have to move your body to the ball in the most ideal position. </br>

<h2> Best Mentality <h2>
  <p> Tennis is all about the mental game. It doesn't matter how well you hit that forehand or how fast your serve is if you can't keep your cool on court. Roger Federer is known and praised for his ability to stay calm in any situation, even if he was losing 6-0.
